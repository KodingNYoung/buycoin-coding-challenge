# Github Repo Clone

This project was made for the buycoin coding challenge, the frontend was made with pure html, css and javascript. I had to use nodejs to make request to github graphql api to hide my personal access token.

## Getting it to work
After cloning or downloading it to your device, in the root directory, open up your terminal and run
```npm install``` to install all the project dependencies. Then:

- [ ] Get your personal access token from github
- [ ] In the root directory create a ```.env``` file and save your access token in the variable name GITHUB_TOKEN.
- [ ] In your terminal, run the command ```npm start```.
- [ ] Go to your browser and visit http://localhost:3000/.

See the magic?
